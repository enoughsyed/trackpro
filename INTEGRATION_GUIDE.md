# Frontend-Backend Integration Guide

## Overview
The Flutter frontend is now fully integrated with the Node.js backend API. All screens communicate with the backend for data persistence and retrieval.

## Integration Mapping

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Login Screen** → `POST /api/auth/login`
  - Validates credentials against database
  - Returns JWT token for session management
  - Redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role

### 👥 User Management
- **Manage Users Screen** → Multiple endpoints:
  - `GET /api/users` - Load all users
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - Add new users
  - `PUT /api/users/:id/role` - Update user roles

- **Assign Users Screen** → Task assignment:
  - `PUT /api/users/:id/assign-task` - Assign tasks
  - `PUT /api/users/:id/unassign-task` - Remove assignments

### 📊 Operations Screens
- **Incoming Inspection** → `POST /api/inspections`
  - Saves inspection data with images
  - Tracks timing and completion status

- **Finishing Operations** → `POST /api/finishing`
  - Records tool usage and process data
  - Monitors tool status and performance

- **Quality Control** → `POST /api/quality`
  - Automatic tolerance validation
  - Saves measurements and inspector signatures

- **Delivery Management** → `POST /api/delivery`
  - Tracks delivery status and proof images
  - Manages customer and transport details

### 📈 Dashboard Integration
- **Admin Dashboard** → `GET /api/dashboard/admin`
  - Real-time operations statistics
  - User performance metrics
  - Recent activity feed

- **Supervisor Dashboard** → `GET /api/dashboard/supervisor`
  - Process overview data
  - User assignment statistics

- **User Dashboard** → `GET /api/dashboard/user`
  - Personal task completion data
  - Assigned work information

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Data Persistence
- All form data is saved to MongoDB
- Images uploaded and stored securely
- Real-time validation and error handling

### ✅ Authentication & Security
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure API communication

### ✅ File Uploads
- Camera integration for inspections
- Signature capture for QC
- Delivery proof images

### ✅ Real-time Updates
- Dashboard statistics from live data
- User assignment synchronization
- Status tracking across operations

## API Response Handling

### Success Responses
```dart
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Responses
```dart
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd trackpro
flutter run
```

### 3. Test Login
- Admin: `admin` / `1234`
- Supervisor: `supervisor` / `1234`
- User: `user` / `1234`

### 4. Test Operations
- Create inspection records
- Assign tasks to users
- Generate QC reports
- Track deliveries

## Error Handling

All screens include comprehensive error handling:
- Network connectivity issues
- API validation errors
- Authentication failures
- File upload problems

## Data Flow

```
Flutter UI → API Service → Express Routes → MongoDB
     ↑                                        ↓
User Actions ← JSON Response ← Database Operations
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all integrated features
2. **Performance**: Optimize API calls and data loading
3. **Offline Support**: Add local storage for offline functionality
4. **Push Notifications**: Real-time updates for critical events
5. **Analytics**: Enhanced reporting and dashboard features

The integration is complete and production-ready with full CRUD operations, file uploads, authentication, and real-time data synchronization between the Flutter frontend and Node.js backend.
